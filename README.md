# 👋 Hi, I'm Akhil.

### Welcome to my Github profile! 🎉

I am a self-taught **Product Designer** with an affinity for code, and a passion 💙 for building great things.

You can check out my design work in my [design portfolio ✨](https://akhillochen.github.io/product-design-portfolio/website/), and the code that runs it [here](https://github.com/akhillochen/product-design-portfolio).

Apart from design, I enjoy making music 🎧 and sharing it on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSUV_YG21xg3sweRfzR6cZQ).

Currently, I am a final year engineering student pursuing my B.Tech in ECE from NIT Trichy (one of India’s Top #10 engineering colleges).

🚀 I’m available to take on new interesting projects and learn more! Feel free to contact me at: [akhillochen@gmail.com](mailto:akhillochen@gmail.com).
