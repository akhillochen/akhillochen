# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Akhil

I am a self-taught Product Designer with an affinity for code, and a passion ðŸ’™ for building great things.

I derive immense satisfaction in taking an idea to the drawing board (Figma), to creating a working prototype, and finally being able to bring it to life with code, which is exactly how I built [my portfolio website](https://akhillochen.github.io/product-design-portfolio/website/index.html)! ðŸ› ðŸ”¥ I am also a vehement learner. I just love learning stuff that intrigues me, especially while doing challenging projects. I believe great design can provide businesses a competitive advantage and cause a positive impact in users' people's lives.

Apart from design, I enjoy making music ðŸŽ§ and sharing it on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSUV_YG21xg3sweRfzR6cZQ).

Currently, I am a final year engineering student pursuing my B.Tech in ECE from NIT Trichy (one of Indiaâ€™s Top #10 engineering colleges).

ðŸš€ Iâ€™m available to take on new interesting projects and learn more! Feel free to contact me at: [akhillochen@gmail.com](mailto:akhillochen@gmail.com).
